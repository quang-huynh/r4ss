\title{Plot matrix of either length or observed age at true age}
\usage{
SSplotAgeMatrix(replist, option = 1, scale = 0.9, plot = TRUE,
  print = FALSE, labels = c("Age", "Length", "True age", "Observed age",
  "for ageing error type", "Distribution of", "at"), pwidth = 6.5,
  pheight = 5, punits = "in", res = 300, ptsize = 10, cex.main = 1,
  addmain = TRUE, plotdir = "default")
}
\arguments{
\item{replist}{List created by \code{SS_output}}

\item{option}{Switch set to either 1 for length at true age or
2 for obs. age at true age}

\item{scale}{Multiplier for bars showing distribution. Species with many ages
benefit from expanded bars. Future default could be function of number of ages
or variability among bins within each age. Current default is 3.}

\item{plot}{Plot to active plot device?}

\item{print}{Print to PNG files?}

\item{labels}{Vector of labels for plots (titles and axis labels)}

\item{pwidth}{Width of plot}

\item{pheight}{Height of plot}

\item{punits}{Units for PNG file}

\item{res}{Resolution for PNG file}

\item{ptsize}{Point size for PNG file}

\item{cex.main}{Character expansion for plot titles}

\item{addmain}{switch which allows the plot title to be left off}

\item{plotdir}{directory where PNG files will be written. by default it will
be the directory where the model was run.}
}
\description{
Distribution of length at age or observed age at true age is represented
as a histogram. Values are from the AGE_LENGTH_KEY and AGE_AGE_KEY sections
of Report.sso ($ALK and $AAK in the list created by SS_output)
