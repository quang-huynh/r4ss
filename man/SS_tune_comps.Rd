\usage{
SS_tune_comps(
  replist,
  fleets = "all",
  option = "Francis",
  digits = 6,
  write = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{replist}{List output from SS_output}

\item{fleets}{Either the string 'all', or a vector of fleet numbers}

\item{option}{Which type of tuning: 'none', 'Francis', or 'MI'}

\item{digits}{Number of digits to round numbers to}

\item{write}{Write suggested tunings to a file 'suggested_tunings.ss'}

\item{verbose}{A logical value specifying if output should be printed
to the screen. The default is \code{verbose = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Returns a table that can be copied into the control file.
If \code{write=TRUE} then will write the values to a file
(currently hardwired to go in the directory where the model was run
and called "suggested_tunings.ss")
}
\description{
Creates a table of values that can be copied into the SS control file
for SS 3.30 models to adjust the input sample sizes for length and age
compositions based on either the Francis or McAllister-Ianelli tuning.
}
\details{
Note: starting with SS version 3.30.12, the "Length_Comp_Fit_Summary"
table in Report.sso is already in the format required to paste into
the control file to apply the McAllister-Ianelli tuning. However, this
function provides the additional option of the Francis tuning and the
ability to compare the two approaches.  Also note, that the
Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood is an alternative approach that allow
the tuning factor to be estimated rather than iteratively tuned.
