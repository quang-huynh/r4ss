\usage{
SS_readctl(file, ctlversion = "3.24", verbose = TRUE,
  echoall = FALSE, nseas = 4, N_areas = 1, Nages = 20,
  Ngenders = 1, Npopbins = NA, Nfleet = 2, Nsurveys = 2,

}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Filename either with full path or relative to working directory.}

\item{ctlversion}{SS version number. Currently only "3.24" or "3.30" are supported,
either as character or numeric values (noting that numeric 3.30  = 3.3).}

\item{verbose}{Should there be verbose output while running the file?
Default=TRUE.}

\item{echoall}{Debugging tool (not fully implemented) of echoing blocks of
data as it is being read.}

\item{nseas}{number of season in the model. This information is not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{N_areas}{number of spatial areas in the model. This information is also not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{Nages}{oldest age in the model. This information is also not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{Ngenders}{number of genders in the model. This information is also not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{Npopbins}{number of population bins in the model. This information is
also not explicitly available in control file and this information is only
required if length based
 maturity vector is directly supplied (Maturity option of 6), and not yet tested}

\item{Nfleet}{number of fisheries in the model. This information is also not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{Nsurveys}{number of survey fleets in the model. This information is also not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{DatFile}{read datfile list for additional information for version 3.30
and above}

\item{N_tag_groups}{number of tag release groups in the model.
This information is also not explicitly available in control file.}

\item{N_CPUE_obs}{numbere of CPUE observations.}

\description{
Read Stock Synthesis control file into list object in R. This function is a
wrapper which calls either SS_readctl_3.24 or SS_readctl_3.30 (not yet written).
This setup allows those functions to be cleaner (if somewhat redundant)
than a single function that attempts to do everything.
