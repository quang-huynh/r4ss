\title{Plot uncertainty around chosen selectivity ogive from MCMC.}
\usage{
SSplotMCMC_ExtraSelex(post, add = FALSE, nsexes = 1, shift = 0,
  fleetname = "default", col = "blue")
}
\arguments{
\item{post}{A data frame containing either derived_posteriors.sso or a good
subset of it. This can be an element of the list created by the the
\code{\link{SSgetMCMC}} function.}

\item{add}{TRUE/FALSE option to add results to an existing plot.}

\item{nsexes}{Number of sexes in the model (should match model values but is
only used in the title).}

\item{shift}{Optional adjustment to the x values to avoid overlap of
intervals when overplotting on an existing plot.}

\item{fleetname}{Optional input to make the title better. Default will be
something like "Fleet 1", using the numbering from the model.}

\item{col}{Color for points and lines.}
}
\description{
Plot uncertainty in selectivity from an MCMC output for whichever fleet/year
was chosen in the optional extra "more stddev reporting"
}
