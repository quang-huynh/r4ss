\title{Apply Francis composition weighting method TA1.8}
\usage{
SSMethod.TA1.8(fit, type, fleet, part = 0:2, pick.gender = 0:3,
  seas = NULL, method = NULL, plotit = TRUE, printit = TRUE,
  maxpanel = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{Stock Synthesis output as read by r4SS function SS_output}

\item{type}{either 'len' (for length composition data), 'size' (for
generalized size composition data), 'age' (for age composition data),
or 'con' (for conditional age at length data)}

\item{fleet}{vector of one or more fleet numbers whose data are to
be analysed simultaneously (the output N multiplier applies
to all fleets combined)}

\item{part}{vector of one or more partition values; analysis is restricted
to composition data with one of these partition values.
Default is to include all partition values (0, 1, 2).}

\item{pick.gender}{vector of one or more values for Pick_gender; analysis is
restricted to composition data with one of these
Pick_gender values.  Ignored if type=='con'}

\item{seas}{string indicating how to treat data from multiple seasons
'comb' - combine seasonal data for each year and plot against Yr
'sep' - treat seasons separately, plotting against Yr.S
If is.null(seas) it is assumed that there is only one season in
the selected data (a warning is output if this is not true) and
option 'comb' is used.}

\item{method}{a vector of one or more size-frequency method numbers
(ignored unless type = 'size').
If !is.null(method), analysis is restricted to size-frequency
methods in this vector.  NB comps are separated by method}

\item{plotit}{if TRUE, make an illustrative plot like one or more
panels of Fig. 4 in Francis (2011).}

\item{printit}{if TRUE, print results to R console.}

\item{maxpanel}{maximum number of panels within a plot}
}
\description{
Uses method TA1.8 (described in Appendix A of Francis 2011) to do
stage-2 weighting of composition data from a Stock Synthesis model.
Outputs a mutiplier, \emph{w} (with bootstrap 95% confidence interval),
so that \emph{N2y} = \emph{w} x \emph{N1y}, where \emph{N1y} and
\emph{N2y} are the stage-1 and stage-2
multinomial sample sizes for the data set in year y.  Optionally
makes a plot of observed (with confidence limits, based on \emph{N1y})
and expected mean lengths (or ages).

CAUTIONARY/EXPLANATORY NOTE.
The large number of options available in SS makes it very
difficult to be sure that what this function does is
appropriate for all combinations of options.  The following
notes might help anyone wanting to check or correct the code.
\enumerate{
  \item The code first takes the appropriate database (lendbase, sizedbase,
        agedbase, or condbase) and removes un-needed rows.
  \item The remaining rows of the database are grouped into individual
        comps (indexed by vector indx) and relevant statistics (e.g.,
        observed and expected mean length or age), and ancillary data,
        are calculated for each comp (these are stored in pldat - one row
        per comp).
        If the data are to be plotted, the comps are grouped, with each
        group corresponding to a panel in the plot, and groups are indexed
        by plindx.
  \item A single multiplier is calculated to apply to all the comps.
