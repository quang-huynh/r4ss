#' read control file from SS
#' 
#' Read Stock Synthesis control file into list object in R. This function is a
#' wrapper which calls either SS_readctl_3.24 or SS_readctl_3.30 (not yet written).
#' This setup allows those functions to be cleaner (if somewhat redundant)
#' than a single function that attempts to do everything.
#' 
#' 
#' @param file Filename either with full path or relative to working directory.
#' @param version SS version number. Currently only "3.24" or "3.30" are supported,
#' either as character or numeric values (noting that numeric 3.30  = 3.3).
#' @param verbose Should there be verbose output while running the file?
#' Default=TRUE.
#' @param echoall Debugging tool (not fully implemented) of echoing blocks of
#' data as it is being read.
#' @param nseas number of season in the model. This information is not
#'  explicitly available in control file
#' @param N_areas number of spatial areas in the model. This information is also not
#'  explicitly available in control file
#' @param Nages oldest age in the model. This information is also not
#'  explicitly available in control file
#' @param Ngenders number of genders in the model. This information is also not
#'  explicitly available in control file
#' @param Npopbins number of population bins in the model. This information is also not
#'  explicitly available in control file and this information is only required if length based
#'  maturity vector is directly supplied (Maturity option of 6), and not yet tested
#' @param Nfleet number of fisheries in the model. This information is also not
#'  explicitly available in control file
#' @param Nsurveys number of survey fleets in the model. This information is also not
#'  explicitly available in control file
#' @param N_tag_groups number of tag release groups in the model. This information is also not
#'  explicitly available in control file
