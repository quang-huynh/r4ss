#' @param dir A file path to the directory of interest.
#' Typically used with \code{file}, an additional input argument,
#' to specify input and output file paths.
#' The default value is \code{dir = NULL}, which leads to using
#' the current working directory, and thus, full file paths should
#' not be specified for other arguments as they will be appended
#' to \code{dir}.
